# phd_journey
documents my work

Hi, liyana here. I want to learn how github functions and i hope i can apply it to my phd work. The main key things here is to record what I have done systematically and retractable. Since my prof suggest github for my daily research routine update, I thought I would have give it a try. 
So..here it goes..hihi...
